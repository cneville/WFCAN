Group 1 Project Description

Our group will be collaborating with Ashely Kryscynski from the Washtenaw Futures College Access Network (WFCAN). 

From the client:
The Washtenaw Futures College Access Network is a cross-sector, community collaborative working to increase post-secondary access and attainment in Washtenaw County to 70%, with a focus on increasing opportunities for first generation college-going students, racial and ethnic minority students, and economically disadvantaged students. One of the most common barriers to accessing post-secondary education is a lack of knowledge about the process, and the resources available to help ease the burden and make navigating the process easier and less intimidating for students and families.

Our group has not yet been able to meet with our client in person. However, we have heard back from Ashley, and will be setting up a meeting to further discuss the needs of the WFCAN. 

We will be looking to develop requirements for a web application, and possibly a mobile application that educates students and their families on the college application process, and increases visibility to the resources available. If needed, we will create a database to store user information. It might also be necessary to create a table to hold information about colleges and their application resources. 

Some key components we have identified are: This is where we can talk about the materials we produced during our in class activity.

The client has mentioned that she is concerned about the maintenance involved in keeping an application running after the completion of the course semester. We will have to discuss potential solutions, or present the minimum requirements for maintaining the application. 

Immediately recognizable stakeholders include Ashley, the WFCAN, new high school graduates and their families.
